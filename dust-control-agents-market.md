<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dust Control Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic Salt</li><li>Polymer Emulsion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dust control agents market primarily features two types: inorganic salts and polymer emulsions. Inorganic salts, such as calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, attract moisture, effectively binding dust particles to surfaces. These agents are often cost-effective and widely used for road maintenance and industrial applications. Polymer emulsions, on the other hand, create a film that encapsulates dust particles, providing longer-lasting control and enhancing stability. They are typically utilized in more demanding environments where durability and performance are crucial.</p></p>
