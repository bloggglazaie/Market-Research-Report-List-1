<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crystalline Fructose for Food Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Starch Hydrolysis</li><li>Sucrose Hydrolysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crystalline fructose is a sweetener derived from natural sources, primarily produced through the hydrolysis of starch or sucrose. In the starch hydrolysis market, enzymes convert starch into glucose, which can then be further processed into fructose. In the sucrose hydrolysis market, sucrase enzymes break down sucrose into glucose and fructose, resulting in a sweet product. Both processes yield crystalline fructose, widely used in food formulations for its high sweetness level and lower caloric content compared to traditional sugars.</p></p>
