<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Bioreactor Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Separate MBR</li><li>Integral MBR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) systems are vital in wastewater treatment, with two main market types: Separate MBR and Integral MBR. Separate MBR systems combine a bioreactor with a membrane filtration unit operating independently, providing flexibility in design and operation. In contrast, Integral MBR systems incorporate membrane filtration directly within the bioreactor, enhancing efficiency and space utilization. Both types effectively remove contaminants, but their choice depends on specific application needs, space constraints, and operational requirements in various settings.</p></p>
